# M3U-to-Google-Play-Music
Convert local music playlist files from m3u format to become playlists in Google Play Music

This is for those of us that still have libraries of MP3 files and playlists in m3u format.  m3u is still a great way to manage playlists and is used by many media players (e.g. Winamp, iTunes).

This is quick and dirty script you can run regularly to:
  - scan a directory of local m3u playlists
  - pull down all playlists you have in Google Play Music
  - compare and identfy what playlists are not in Google
  - grab MP3 tags from local songs and find the IDs of those songs in Google
  - use those IDs to recreate those playlists in Google Play Muaic
